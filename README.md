 The objective of this project is to develop a web application aimed at cake identification utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and Transfer Learning. Implementing such a system in a coffee shop can greatly enhance inventory management and ensure the freshness of baked goods. Leveraging image recognition technology, employees can effortlessly capture a photo of a cake, which the system can then identify using the pre-trained CNN model. Furthermore, the application can seamlessly integrate with a database to monitor cake expiration dates, promptly notifying staff when cakes approach their expiration dates. This approach guarantees that only cakes within their designated expiration dates are displayed, minimizing waste and guaranteeing the availability of fresh cakes at all times. Ultimately, this web application offers a convenient and efficient solution for effectively managing cake inventory and freshness within a coffee shop setting.
